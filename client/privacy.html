  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> If you log in with Google, we receive your email and basic profile information (name, Google account ID).</li>
    <li><strong>Messages:</strong> Messages you send in rooms are stored so they can be translated and displayed. Messages may include original text, translations, timestamps, and usernames.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide translations and audio via OpenAI Whisper and GPT models.</li>
    <li>To allow GPT to summarize entire conversations or parts of them when you request that feature.</li>
    <li>To manage rooms, usernames, and session data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Processing</h2>
  <p>Messages are transmitted to OpenAI’s APIs (ChatGPT and Whisper) for processing. These services may process the data temporarily in order to return results.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Messages are stored in our system until they are deleted automatically (based on expiration settings) or by the user. Deleted messages and rooms are not recoverable.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. Messages are not shared with other parties except as necessary to provide translation features (OpenAI).</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>

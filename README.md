### Updates

- Fixed the issue where messages meant to be room specific could be seen from other rooms.

- Room name and its nickname are shown in the main ui now. That data comes from localStorage.

### Next 

- Option to save a room url they visit to localStorage. At the moment, rooms can only be saved when creating a room.

- Then, generate a QR code from that room url.

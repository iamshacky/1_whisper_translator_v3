- Login let's you log in with a password that doesn't match.
- Let's you log in if no account has been created yet.
- I don't know if the above are good or bad, because there may be different login/permission modes. 
- For now, it works well enough to display username of message sender and show "You said:..." if your logged in and you sent the message.

## Next plan

- Refactor a bit. Separate the moderator logic from various other files.
